I have undertaken a course; "Crucial Skills for Software Developers" which is being administered and taught by The Coders Guild, to provider further skills and to build on the foundations of my self-studies that I have been undertaking. 

I am using this 11ty blog as a base for my portfolio to showcase the skills I have learned on the course to prospective employers in the software development industry.
