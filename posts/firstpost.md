Hello, my name is James and this blog will be documenting the lessons I have completed whilst undertaking a front-end web development course which has been administered by The Coder's Guild, called "Crucial Skills for Web Developers". This course will run over a roughly twelve week schedule with sessions being on Monday evenings and later on Mondays and Thursdays, with the final session being on 19th December. 

During our first introductory session, which was run by founder and CEO of The Coder's Guild, Crispin Read, we had a brief introduction to the Jamstack (previously stylised as JAMstack), which is what we would be learning in this course. 

Jamstack stands for: 

<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>API</li>
<li>Markup</li>
</ul>

and is a "web development architecture  pattern and solution stack" which is designed to improve and simplify the building of websites and apps through the use of static-site generators and APIs. 

The aim of this course is to establish a foundation on which we can build our skills in utilising the Jamstack and starting our journey to becoming web developers. Our main goal will be to develop a portfolio of work which we can showcase to prospective employers which we will achieve by learning skills in using HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as a static-site generator such as eleventy, to build this very site that you are reading now.
